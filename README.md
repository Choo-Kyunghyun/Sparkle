# Sparkle

![Sparkle](assets/splash.png)

Sparkle is an open-source [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en) project. The goal of this project is to make the various features as easy to use as possible. This project is in its early stages and there may be inconsistent changes.

## Features

### Hierarchy

The project has a unique hierarchical structure. Each game element exists as a sub-element of the top-level element called Game. This makes maintenance easy and improves code readability.

### UI Manager

The UI elements placed in the Room editor are automatically managed by the manager. Each element is automatically updated.

### Camera

A camera object that supports both 2D and 3D is provided. Various methods and update scripts are available. You can place the configuration object in the Room editor to select and use the desired camera. Update scripts for different genres of games are provided.

### Input Manager

Input Manager When binding input keys, they are stored as functions rather than constants. This allows you to manage all types of inputs, such as keyboard, mouse, and gamepad, in a single table. It supports key setting presets.

### Delta Time

Everything will move independently of the frame rate.

### Actor Manager

In this project, both players and non-playable characters are actors. An actor object is provided, and the actor manager will manage them.

### Audio Manager

The audio manager will be supported in the future.

### String

Do you want to use various colors and fonts in a single string? Use String. You can change the color in the middle of the string with color tags like `<color=#666666>`, or change the font in the middle with font tags like `<font=fnt_sparkle>`. This String is used in various UIs of this project.
